# CouchRest: CouchDB, close to the metal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/couchrest/couchrest.png)](https://travis-ci.org/couchrest/couchrest)

CouchRest wraps CouchDB's HTTP API using persistent connections with the [HTTPClient gem](https://github.com/nahi/httpclient) managing servers, databases, and JSON document serialization using CouchDB's API endpoints so you don't have to.

CouchRest is designed to provide a simple base for application and framework-specific object oriented APIs. CouchRest is Object-Mapper agnostic, the JSON objects provided by CouchDB are parsed and returned as Document objects providing a simple Hash-like interface.

For more complete modelling support based on ActiveModel, please checkout CouchRest's sister project: [CouchRest Model](https://github.com/couchrest/couchrest_model).

## CouchDB Version

Tested on latest stable release (1.6.X), but should work on older versions above 1.0. Also known to work on [Cloudant](http://cloudant.com).

## Install

    $ sudo gem install couchrest

## Basic Usage


```ruby
CouchRest.configure do |config|
  config.server_url = "http://localhost:5984"

  config.connection.ssl_client_cert = 'cert'
  config.connection.ssl_client_key = 'cert-key'
  config.connection.ssl_ca_file = 'ca-file'
  config.connection.verify_ssl = nil            # true/false

  config.connection.timeout = 1000
  config.connection.open_timeout = 2000
  config.connection.read_timeout = 3000
end

server = CouchRest.new # should use configured server and connection settings.
```

Getting started with CouchRest is easy. You can send requests directly to a URL using a [RestClient](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client)-like interface:

```ruby
CouchRest.put("http://localhost:5984/testdb/doc", 'name' => 'test', 'date' => Date.current)
```

Or use the lean server and database orientated API to take advantage of persistent and reusable connections:

```ruby
server = CouchRest.new           # assumes localhost by default!
db = server.database!('testdb')  # create db if it doesn't already exist

# Save a document, with ID
db.save_doc('_id' => 'doc', 'name' => 'test', 'date' => Date.current)

# Fetch doc
doc = db.get('doc')
doc.inspect # #<CouchRest::Document _id: "doc", _rev: "1-defa304b36f9b3ef3ed606cc45d02fe2", name: "test", date: "2015-07-13">

# Delete
db.delete_doc(doc)
```

## Running the Specs

The most complete documentation is the spec/ directory. To validate your
CouchRest install, from the project root directory use bundler to install 
the dependencies and then run the tests:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake

To date, the couchrest specs have been shown to run on:

 * MRI Ruby 1.9.3 and later
 * JRuby 1.7.19
 * Rubinius 2.5.7

See the [Travis Build status](https://travis-ci.org/couchrest/couchrest) for more details.
